            <h2>Fiber Crops</h2>
            <p>Fiber crops are characterized by having a large concentration of cellulose, which is what gives them their strength. The fibers may be chemically modified, like in viscose (used to make rayon and cellophane). In recent years, materials scientists have begun exploring further use of these fibers in composite materials. Due to cellulose being the main factor of a plant fiber's strength, this is what scientists are looking to manipulate to create different types of fibers.

            <h2>Oil crops</h2>
            <p>Oil crops are those types of plants which are grown mainly for the oil they produce. For example: soybeans, canola, avocados, grapes, and almonds. Soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers, and canola are mainly used to produce edible oils.

                Sunflowers are used to produce sunflower oils, peanuts are used to produce peanut oil (Ground nut oil) which is widely used to fry foods in many countries. Canola is used to produce Canola oil while Soybeans are used to produce Soya bean oil.
