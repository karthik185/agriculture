            <h2>Home Decoration</h2>
            <p>If you find it difficult to be available for tending to your garden, artificial plants are your solution. Bedeck your garden with colourful artificial flowers to add to its beauty and elegance. This gives you the double advantage of having a variety of flowers without the hassles of maintenance. Even with the natural plants, artificial trees are a perfect accessory for your garden. 

                Plants and fresh flowers are the best way to add personality, greenery, and a fresh vibe to a space. A home full of heavy elements tends to look stuffy, but a quick addition of plants makes sure that the room suddenly looks light, bright, and brought to life. However, natural plants and fresh flowers can be a complete and absolute pain to maintain.

            <p>Our experts all agreed: Being able to witness frequent growth from your plants is key for any beginner. In other words, you want to see that your effort is paying off—fast. “I think anyone who's a first-time plant parent is looking for a plant that is going to give them the satisfaction of seeing that they're doing something well,” Greene says.
                What's more, Pham suggests looking for dramatic, communicative plants that curl up their leaves, droop, and fan out when they need water and sunlight. “I love any display of body language from plants, because it's your cue to care for it,” she says.

            <h2>Cut Flowers</h2>
            <p>Cut flowers are flowers and flower buds (often with some stem and leaf) that have been cut from the plant bearing it. It is removed from the plant for decorative use. Cut greens are leaves with or without stems added to the cut flowers for contrast and design purposes. These displays improve the quality of the human environment.

                Floral design professionals work at florist shops (floristry) and use their design skills and experience with many types of flowers and greens to create works of art with flowers.
